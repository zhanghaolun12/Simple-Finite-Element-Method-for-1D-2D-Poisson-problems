# Codes of Finite Element Methods for Poisson Problems

## Introduction

* All codes here are written in Python.
* The codes are rewritten from Matlab codes written by He Xiaoming, so if you have studied the online course on the FEM of He Xiaoming and corresponding MATLAB codes, you can quickly understand these programs.
* The simple codes solve 1D and 2D Poisson problem. 

## Noting

Use this code whatever you want, but please send me an email first  (zhanghl@mail.nwpu.edu.cn).
